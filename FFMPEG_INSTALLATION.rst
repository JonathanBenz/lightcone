FFMPEG Installation
=========

FFMPEG installation is required to create MP4 files of the animated lightcurves.

* Free download: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.

After downloading, make sure you include the FFMPEG binary directory (e.g. C:\\users\\user\\ffmpeg\\bin) to your PATH.

On Windows you can edit your environment variables and edit your Path to add to it. You may want to restart your PC after doing so too.
